Build Chatbot using ChatGPT and Python

The code starts by importing the openai library.
Next, it sets up an environment variable called OPENAI_Key with the API key from OpenAI.
Then it starts a loop that prompts for input and stores it in a variable called prompt.
The code then checks if the user typed ‘exit’ to stop prompting them for input, which would mean they are done answering questions and want to exit this program.
If so, keep_prompting is set to False and execution stops running through the loop; otherwise, execution continues until there is no more input left or all 200 tokens have been used up.
The next line creates a completion object using text-DaVinci-003 as its engine type and prompt as its prompt argument (the string that will be shown when asking users what their question was).
This completes one task at a time because max_tokens=200 tells us how many tasks can be completed before we need to ask again for new input from our user.
The code is an example of how to use the OpenAI gym API.
The code starts by importing the necessary libraries, then opens up a prompt for input from the user and stores it in a variable called prompt.
The user enters their question which will be stored in response.
If the user enters exit, then keep_prompting is set to false and if not, then openai completion engine is used to return a list of choices that can be selected from with text associated with each choice.
